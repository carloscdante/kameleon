## Introduction

Kameleon is a library for API request automation and testing, while also being a documentation generator. It's aimed to be fully compatible with the OpenAPI standard, but simpler to write and easier to test. Want to separate your test files for each route prefix? Easy. Want to generate your docs without having to write the whole spec? You can! Converting Kameleon to OpenAPI 3.0 seamlessly? Also possible. Everything with only a few commands.
